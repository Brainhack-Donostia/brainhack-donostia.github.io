The first edition of Brainhack Donostia was held in May 2018 at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), a world-class interdisciplinary research center located in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain. For three days, attendees from all over Europe worked together and learned about various neuroimaging tools and software for data handling (involving data preprocessing, analysis, and presentation). Specialized talks on how to process and analyze MRI, MEG, and NIRS data using state-of-the-art tools were complemented by hands-on tutorials where attendees were able to put these procedures into practice. Despite being a pilot experience, Brainhack Donostia 2018 was a success. We hosted 50 attendees from across Europe, and participants' feedback after the event was positive. The second edition was an even greater success, with more than 70 participants! The challenge of Brainhack Donostia 2019 was to improve the development of projects in order to generate collaborations that would continue beyond the event. For the first time, we had two international speakers: Dimitri Van De Ville and Matteo Bastiani. Our guest speakers brought new experiences and knowledge to the table, contributing to our goal of promoting and sharing knowledge in an open and transparent way between disciplines and specialties, as well as to the development of open source tools.

Despite the challenges we have faced and continue to work through in 2020, this year, Brainhack Donostia is going to be bigger and better than before! With our new online format, you will have access to workshops, invited talks, and hands-on projects in four main areas of interest: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion imaging (DTI), and Open Science. A gender-balanced board of researchers from BCBL is currently building a five-day workshop composed of talks, tutorials, and project development sessions. Following the philosophy of Brainhack, we will focus on learning and developing high-quality, cutting-edge tools for handling neuroimaging data, while also sharing experiences and building new collaborations among researchers, students, and industry professionals. This year, we want to improve project development and, in particular, create collaborations that will continue past the event. In addition and for the first time, we will host three international keynote speakers that will share their experience and knowledge in their respective neuroimaging areas of expertise. By doing so, we will continue to grow our contributions towards sharing knowledge openly and transparently across disciplines and specialties, and to the development of open-source tools.

**Ileana Quiñones**

Postdoctoral researcher @ BCBL. Is there a causal link between individual differences in cognitive abilities and the architecture of the human connectome? Can the human connectome re-orchestrate the function(s) of its constituent nodes in order to cope with brain lesions? Does the malleability of the human connectome represent an adaptive advantage for post-surgery brain recovery processes? Her current research attempts to answer these questions using a combination of different non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI, fMRI, and DTI.
