The first edition of Brainhack Donostia was held in May 2018 at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), a world-class interdisciplinary research center located in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain. For three days, attendees from all over Europe worked together and learned about various neuroimaging tools and software for data handling (involving data preprocessing, analysis, and presentation). Specialized talks on how to process and analyze MRI, MEG and NIRS data using state-of-the-art tools were complemented by hands-on tutorials where attendees were able to put these procedures into practice. Despite being a pilot experience, Brainhack Donostia 2018 was a success. We hosted 50 attendees from across Europe, and participants’ feedback after the event was positive.

The second edition was an even greater success, with more than 70 participants! The challenge of Brainhack Donostia 2019 was to improve the development of projects in order to generate collaborations that would continue beyond the event. For the first time, we had two international speakers: Dimitri Van De Ville and Matteo Bastiani. Our guest speakers brought new experiences and knowledge to the table, contributing to our goal of promoting and sharing knowledge in an open and transparent way between disciplines and specialties, as well as to the development of open source tools.

Despite the challenges of 2020 we continued to work to organize the very first virtual edition of BrainHack Donostia. This new online format allowed us to reach more participants and invited speakers than ever before. Last year's event counted with more than 100 participants from all over the world, and focused primarily on four main areas of interest: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion imaging (DTI), and Open Science.
## Committee

**Lucía Manso**

Co-chair fo BHD2022. PhD candidate @BCBL interested in the organization of neural networks, brain plasticity related to life changing events (learning a new language or even undergoing surgery) and computational neuroscience. When not at the lab she enjoys cooking and hiking.

**Eneko Uruñuela**

Ex-chair of BHD. PhD student @ BCBL and biomedical engineer. His research focuses on the development of deconvolution methods for fMRI. As a proper engineer, he’s a computer/phone/tech/programming geek. He also loves hiking (especially at sunset) and photography, and is into playing the electric guitar. Finally, he’s a big (not so) secret fan of the 80s.

**Hülya Aldemir**

Ex-research trainee @ BCBL, now a PhD student @ University of Seville. Her ongoing research life revolves around psycholinguistics - and currently works on helping vocabulary growth for deaf children and adolescents as a part of a MSCA ITN team, "Early Language Development in the Digital Age". She fancies napping and tweeting.

**César Caballero-Gaudes**

César likes developing new signal processing algorithms and imaging methods to understand human brain function, mainly using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Lately, he has been interested in novel analyses of dynamic functional connectivity and multi-echo functional MRI. If he finds you around, he might invite you to participate in one of his MRI studies with highly-sampled individuals. Apart from research, he tries to be a good father and an appropriate mentor for his students.

**Inés Chavarría**

PhD student @ BCBL, currently working on fMRI sequence development but interested in most engineering aspects of the MRI. My interests outside work are even wider: volleyball, crochet, art, Stephen King, board games, climbing, chocolate, traveling... and, of course, I do enjoy a little bit of programming!

**Laura Fernandez-Merino**

PhD student @ BCBL studying cortical tracking of speech and music in bilingual infants, and its role in language acquisition and speech perception. When she is not surfing brain waves in the BabyLab, she likes surfing real waves and playing piano.

**Garikoitz Lerma-Usabiaga**

He is interested in using behavioral, functional, and structural MRI techniques to investigate the neural basis of vision and reading, and in the development of quantitative methods to enhance neuroimaging reproducibility and clinical application. Currently, he is in his third year at Stanford University working on population receptive fields, diffusion MRI, and single-subject quantification methods to better understand and characterize reading in proficient and poor readers.

**Abraham Sánchez**

PhD student @ BCBL. Mainly interested in memory processes and how the brain establishes concepts from percepts.

**Manuel Carreiras**

Ikerbasque Research Professor and Scientific Director @ BCBL. Working on research for over 30 years, he has lots of experience in psycho and neurolinguistics.
