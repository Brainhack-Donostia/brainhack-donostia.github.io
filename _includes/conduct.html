                Brainhack is dedicated to providing a harassment-free Brainhack experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
                We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.
                Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.
            </p>

            <h4 class="section-heading">Enforcement</h4>
            <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 18px">
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. <br />
                Organizers and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. <br />
                Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. <br />
                If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers have the responsibility to remind the offender about Brainhackâ€™s Code of Conduct, and warn them that repeated inappropriate, uncivil, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior can lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the event with no refund.
                The offending person(s) may also see affected their participation in future Brainhack events. <br />
                We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
