			<h3 class="section-heading">Helmholz never published in Nature Neuroscience <br/> <a href="https://github.com/qtabs/surprisalingFactor/"> (@qtabs)</a> </h3>

			<p class="text-muted"> Surprisal theory in psycholinguistics proposes that the harder a word is to predict from context, the more cognitive effort it takes to process. This project applies surprisal measures to characterize major journals in cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology, testing whether surprisal distributions align with journal-level metrics (impact factor) or article-level metrics (citations).
				We will automate pipelines to extract articles, compute surprisal using open-source LLMs, run exploratory analyses, and write a report exploring whether highly cited papers in neuroscience embrace more or less linguistic surprise.</p>
			<h3 class="section-subsubheading text-muted">
				Goals</h3>
			<p class="text-muted"> Set up an automated pipeline to scrape full-text neuroscience articles from 20-100 major journals in the field<br />
			Compute surprisal scores using an open-source LLM to calculate average word-level surprisal for a minimum of 50 articles per journal<br />
			Define exploratory analyses and collect appropriate journal/article metrics (e.g., impact factor, year, citations, sub-field)<br /> 
			Produce visualizations comparing surprisal distributions with the collected metrics<br /> 
			Generate collaborative interpretation of the results<br /> 
			Draft a short report summarizing context, methods, results, and limitations<br /> </p>

			<h3 class="section-heading">Implementing denoising within phys2cvr software <br/> <a href="https://github.com/Brainhack-Donostia/brainhack-donostia.github.io/issues/172"> (César Caballero Gaudes)</a> </h3>

			<p class="text-muted"> This project will aim to implement a denoising module within the phys2cvr software for cerebrovascular reactivity mapping. Briefly, we will create a module that 
				implements the removal of the nuisance regressors (i.e. denoising) based on the lagged-GLM approach of phys2cvr. 
				This will involve understanding the phys2cvr pipeline and developing an efficient approach of the denoising step. </p>
			<h3 class="section-subsubheading text-muted">
				Goals</h3>

			<p class="text-muted"> The deliverable will be to implement this step and make it work.<br /> </p>

			<h3 class="section-heading">FAIR-PsyFlow: making psychological assessment methods and data FAIR by design <br/> <a href="https://github.com/Brainhack-Donostia/brainhack-donostia.github.io/issues/173"> (Inês Almeida)</a> </h3>

			<p class="text-muted"> This workshop aims to discuss barriers, opportunities and best practices in psychological assessment (with extensions, input from and output to 
				behavioural research) using the lens of responsible and open science, reproducibility and FAIR principles. The end goal is to provide an opportunity for critically 
				thinking about these topics, hands-on training, and to create a workflow to guide researchers in best practices from the project starting point.</p>
			<h3 class="section-subsubheading text-muted">
				Goals</h3>
			<p class="text-muted"> The workshop aims to build insight and develop a best-practices workflow (in line with responsible and open research, and FAIR principles) 
				for psychology that can be used, collaboratively worked and reused by others - with particular focus in the field of psychological assessment methods and data. 
				The goal it to make methods selection, application & reporting, and data management & sharing more transparent, easy and best practices compliant, motivating 
				all to prepare responsibly and share transparently their research practices and outputs – which are more diverse than a final thesis, research article or publication!<br />

				By the end of the workshop, a workflow (draft version) to implement in GitHub or in another collaborative platform should be created. This should contain key steps, 
				best practices and useful resources to think critically when designing a study or project in Psychology research (in particular when using psychological assessment methods and data).<br /> </p>
