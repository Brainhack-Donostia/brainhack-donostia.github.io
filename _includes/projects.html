		    <p class="text-muted"> This project is a toolbox that allows researchers in neuroimage to apply clustering methods to fMRI data on the spatiotemporal domain. Conventional methods of clustering in fMRI allow to see spatial patterns but cannot describe the temporal dynamics of functional activity.<br /> 
		    Providing a tool for researchers interested in analyzing brain patterns in uncontrolled fmri experiments or clinical settings is a necessity that has not been covered yet and that could be done through clustintime. <br />
		    The project already has its repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/Cristina-Tobias/clustintime">see repo</a>) and a public fMRI data will be used for testing. </p>

			    Goals</h3>
		    <p class="text-muted"> Create integration testing suite/framework<br />
Create CI/CD pipeline<br />
Populate CI/CD pipeline with checks<br /> </p>

		    <p class="text-muted"> 
		    TE-dependent analysis (tedana) is a Python library for denoising multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. tedana originally came about as a part of the ME-ICA pipeline, although it has since diverged. An important distinction is that while the ME-ICA pipeline originally performed both pre-processing and TE-dependent analysis of multi-echo fMRI data <br />

		    <h3 class="section-heading">phys2CVR: a BIDS-compliant python toolbox to compute cerebrovascular reacitvity mapping <br/> <a href="https://github.com/smoia"> (@smoia)</a> </h3>

		    <p class="text-muted"> phys2cvr is a python toolbox that aims at offering various approaches to compute cerebrovascular mapping, starting from at least a functional MRI hypervolume.

		    While not the first toolbox to compute CVR out there, I'm aiming at making something easy to adopt, a swiss knife to compute all sorts of maps to image cerebral physiology (not to denoise fMRI timeseries, for that you can check <a href= "https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise">phys2denoise </a>). phys2cvr should become one of the most complete tools for CVR mapping available, easy to adopt through a CLI (and, if possible, a GUI), with nice reports and plots, and allowing the highest automation through BIDS compliance. No repetition allowed thoough: for all python-based approaches out there, phys2cvr should only act as wrap around.
All contributions are welcome - and all contributions are recognised via all-contributors guidelines (and authorship on publications). </p>
