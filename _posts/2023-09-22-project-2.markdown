description: "The waste clearance system of the brain, novel imaging techniques and challenges: The waste clearance system of the brain is a recent discovery in human anatomy. Its existence has only been demonstrated less than 10 years ago, but impairment of this system has been found in both healthy aging and various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Being such a novel discovery and due to the high clinical impact of this system, there is a strong need for the development of non-invasive imaging techniques that enable investigation of the waste clearance system in humans. In this talk, we will start with an overview of the current theories on the cerebral waste clearance system. Thereafter, state-of-the-art MRI techniques used to image parts of this system will be discussed, along with their advantages and shortcomings. We will discuss the recent developments within the field of waste clearance, and highlight the role that open science can play in the advancement of these techniques."
