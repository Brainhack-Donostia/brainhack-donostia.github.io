description: "Statistical models frequently include categorical variables as predictors. By default, R
handles these predictors using indicator coding: one level is treated as the reference
(intercept), and the remaining levels are modeled as deviations from it. This convention
often leads to outputs that are di@icult to interpret, particularly when the predictor has
more than two levels. In such cases, model summaries only provide comparisons against
the reference level, requiring additional pairwise comparisons to assess other contrasts.
The complexity increases further with interaction terms, which also reflect deviations
relative to the reference level. An alternative is sum coding, where levels are assigned
equidistant numeric values that sum to zero. Although sum coding can be useful, it
quickly becomes unintuitive when applied to variables with multiple levels. A third, more
interpretable strategy is to index categorical predictors: the model estimates a
conditional mean for each level, and contrasts of interest are computed post hoc. This
approach simplifies interpretation. Besides, indexing categorical predictors aligns well
with Bayesian regression, where priors must be placed on all model parameters, and
assigning priors to conditional means is often conceptually and practically easier than
assigning them to di@erences from a reference. This talk explores these three
approaches—indicator coding, sum coding, and indexing—and discusses their
implications for model interpretation and communication of results, both in Frequentist
and Bayesian frameworks."
