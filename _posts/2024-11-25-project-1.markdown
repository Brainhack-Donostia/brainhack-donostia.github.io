description: "Marco completed his bachelor studies in Hispanic Philology and Literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. There, he carried out his own research project funded by the Psychology School regarding reading abilities in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and eyetracking. Afterwards, he completed an MSc in Computational Modeling and Scientific Calculus with a specialization in robotics at the Autonomous University of Morelos State (UAEM), Mexico. During this period, he developed a computer model that simulated Cortical connections between different brain areas, and that accounts for audiovisual integration during speech perception. Soon after, he won a Caixa INPhINIT doctoral grant to continue his studies with a PhD in Cognitive Neurosciences at the Basque Center on Cognition Brain and Language (BCBL) and the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU) within the Signal Processing in Neuroimaging research group, and the Speech and Bilingualism group. Currently, he is developing analysis methods to improve MRI signal quality during overt speech production experiments. This will hinder investigation in speech production with MRI. His research interest is language processing but he follows a multidisciplinary perspective including tools from robotics, signal engineering, cognitive sciences, and computer science."
