description: "Bianca earned a BSc in Psychology and an MRes in Developmental Neuroscience and Psychopathology from University College London (UK). She conducted research for her Master’s thesis at Yale University (USA), taking a multidimensional approach to understand the emergence of sex differences in internalizing symptoms in adolescence. She is currently a final year PhD student at the Max Planck School of Cognition, based at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig (Germany). Her research focuses on applying computational approaches to investigate principles of functional brain organization, more specifically studying how features of functional connectivity vary within and between individuals, taking evidence from sex differences, deep phenotyping, pubertal development, and psychopathology. She uses multimodal data in her work, derived from human neuroimaging, serum and salivary hormone sampling, clinical assessments, and self-reported questionnaires. Ultimately, Bianca aims for her work to highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical research to improve health outcomes, particularly in the field of women’s health, which has historically been largely neglected."

abstract: "The sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis is considered to be a key principle of macroscale cortical organization that differentiates unimodal primary/sensorimotor cortical regions from heteromodal/association regions involved in more complex cognitive functions. Although patterns of functional connectivity along this axis are considered to be broadly stable trait-like features of the human brain, there is still a notable degree of variability, both within and between individuals. In this talk, Bianca will present her research on variability in the S-A axis, taking evidence from sex differences and intra-individual differences, and leveraging human neuroimaging open data that bridges across scales - from the dense sampling of deeply phenotyped single individuals to large population neuroscience study consortia."
