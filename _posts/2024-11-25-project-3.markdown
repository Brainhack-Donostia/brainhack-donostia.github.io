description: "Ryland received his Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of Oregon in 2018. He then worked as a Senior Research Technician in the Dosenbach and Greene Labs at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. At WUSM, Ryland helped develop FIRMM (a software that tracks motion in real-time during functional MRI scans), maintained and improved scripts to analyze resting state functional MRI data, and taught programming skills to other lab members. He is currently completing his Master’s degree in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Language and working as a research assistant at the BCBL.  His main focus is on the proper and efficient use of computing resources in fMRI data analysis. To this end, he works on improving methodologies for MRI data collection, storage, and analysis and on teaching other researchers about these best practices.

David holds a degree in Psychology from the University of the Basque Country (UPV). Additionally, he is a certified technician in diagnostic imaging and nuclear medicine (Inmakulada Tolosa). With 12 years of experience as a laboratory technician at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain, and Language (BCBL), he serves as the MRI Coordinator at BCBL. During his master’s thesis (Universitat de Valencia), he worked extensively on converting a multimodal dataset from a BCBL project into BIDS format. This has involved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, electroencephalography (EEG) data, neuropsychological questionnaires, and medical information collected over multiple time points and across three different treatment groups"

abstract: "In the early 2000s, sharing neuroimaging data was a monumental task that was often not feasible. Each lab had their own way of organizing and naming the multitude of different possible files. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was introduced as an effort to correct this problem. By standardizing the format in which data is stored, it not only makes sharing data simple and easy, but also allows for software to be developed that will work on any data formatted according to BIDS. Thus, it is an important tool for any researcher in a modern world of open science and reproducibility. In this tutorial, Ryland and David will explain the basics of the BIDS format and then go into more in-depth examples of how to move datasets from their raw format into BIDS. David will talk about brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, whereas Ryland will talk about electroencephalography (EEG) data."
