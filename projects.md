Got a project idea? Submit!

<a class="submission-button" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Submit</a>

In the spirit of Brainhack, participants are encouraged to propose collaborative projects to be developed by small teams “onsite” (through Zoom) during the event. We would like attendees to sign up for projects to promote active collaboration, and hands-on learning, both during and after the event.

Projects can focus on any technique or method, use behavioral or neuroimaging data, or explore any topic related to Open Science. They can involve any stage of the scientific process, from data acquisition to analysis and documentation, as well as data visualization and scientific publication. You’re also encouraged to work on creating tutorials or improving the documentation of a library/program, or even replicate a paper (and dockerize it!).
To find out more about the projects carried out in previous editions, check out the Brainhack Global website:

The projects will be chosen on the first day of the Brainhack, giving preference to those that were pre-submitted. Participants will be able to work on their projects while the train-track events are taking place (see [schedule page](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io/schedule/)).
 
The activities carried out during Brainhack Donostia 2020 can result in useful output that will be available beyond the current event, as well as new collaborations with peers!
