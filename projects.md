## Key points

We want to encourage participants to join the event with their mindset ready to collaborate on projects and hope it will also lead to a better chance of collaborating and networking. At the same time, we hope it will help project leaders get collaborators too.

Activities carried out during Brainhack Donostia 2022 can result in useful outputs for the neuroscience community. **We highly encourage you to submit a project for this year's edition.** If you are in need of inspiration, have a look at the project ideas we have received so far, or check out the projects submitted to <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global</a> last year.

- Attendees will receive an email days before the event to encourage them to select the project they will work on.
- Projects are the perfect chance for active collaboration, networking and hands-on learning, both during and after the event.

### For project leaders:

- Projects can focus on _any technique or method_, use behavioral or neuroimaging data, or explore any topic related to Open Science.
- Projects can involve _any stage of the scientific process_, from data acquisition to analysis and documentation, as well as data visualization and scientific publication.
- Projects can also be focused on _creating tutorials or improving the documentation_ of a library/program, or even replicating a paper (and dockerize it!).
- Please, make sure tasks are well defined and are suitable for different levels of expertise.
- Note that submitting your project through the Brainhack Donostia website will give you more visibility as it will be displayed on the Brainhack Global website too.
