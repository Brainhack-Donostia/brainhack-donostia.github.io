## Key points

We want to encourage participants to join the event with their mindset ready to collaborate on projects and hope it will also lead to a better chance of collaborating and networking. At the same time, we hope it will help project leaders get collaborators too.

Activities carried out during Brainhack Donostia 2022 can result in useful outputs for the neuroscience community. **We highly encourage you to submit a project for this year's edition.** If you are in need of inspiration, have a look at the project ideas we have received so far, or check out the projects submitted to <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global</a> last year.

### For attendees:

- **Attendees are required to commit to a project for the duration of Brainhack Donostia 2022.**
- Attendees can work on any of the projects on the <a href="https://brainhack.org/global2022/projects" target="_blank">Brainhack Global website</a>.
- Attendees will receive an email days before the event to encourage them to select the project they will work on.
- Projects are the perfect chance for active collaboration, networking and hands-on learning, both during and after the event.

### For project leaders:

- Projects can focus on _any technique or method_, use behavioral or neuroimaging data, or explore any topic related to Open Science.
- Projects can involve _any stage of the scientific process_, from data acquisition to analysis and documentation, as well as data visualization and scientific publication.
- Projects can also be focused on _creating tutorials or improving the documentation_ of a library/program, or even replicating a paper (and dockerize it!).
- Please, make sure tasks are well defined and are suitable for different levels of expertise.
- Note that submitting your project through the Brainhack Donostia website will give you more visibility as it will be displayed on the Brainhack Global website too.

  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">TE-dependent analysis (tedana) is a Python library for denoising multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. tedana originally came about as a part of the ME-ICA pipeline, although it has since diverged.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">NeuroCausal: a FAIRer neuropsychology</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">We are working with clinicians, neuroimagers, and software developers to develop an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of human clinical data to the service of the clinical and cognitive neuroscience community so that the future of neuropsychology can be transdiagnostic, open, and FAIR.
Following the steps of what enable a similar transition in functional neuroimaging, we are breaking down our over-ambitious goal in two stages: (1) create a meta-analytical platform covering lesion-related data hence allowing causal inferences; (2) a data-sharing platform tailored to clinical needs.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size: 1.8em">Hacking Brainhack!</h4>
  <p style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">We're preparing a global MEG/EEG meeting next year in October with our non-profit conference organisation CuttingEEG. We call it CuttingGardens. It is made of "Gardens" that host their own local event, and connect together and with the global community via live sessions. We would like to create a platform similar to https://brainhack.org/global2022/ on which we could:

    offer resources for applying Gardens, similar to what Brainhack has here.
    collect Garden candidates via a submission form similar to what Brainhack has here for local events.
    Display the catalog of tutorial, lectures, and other local events in a dynamic way, perhaps in a similar way as what Brainhack has here for projects

We have a team of a handful places across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, willing to be a Garden. We'd like to facilitate more joining and think Brainhack is a great model!</p>
