Dr. Valentina Borghesani  is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Geneva (UNIGE, FPSE), within the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Evolving Language. After a bachelor’s degree in experimental psychology (UNIBO, Italy), a master’s in neuropsychology (UNITN, Italy), and a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience (UPMC, France), Dr. Borghesani perfected her skills and knowledge with postdoctoral work in both clinical (UCSF, USA) and computational (UdeM, Canada) neuroscience. Her research interest, a multidimensional investigation of the neurocognitive interplay of semantic knowledge and language, requires leveraging a wide array of techniques across different disciplines including neuropsychology, cognitive neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), and computer science. She deeply cares about (and is very active in) aspects of neuroscientific research and ethics (1), community building (2), diversity & inclusivity (3), environmental justice (4), and the arts (5).

## Why the principles of brainhack are important for a cognitive neuroscientist (of language)? My personal motivations to join this community and how it has enriched my scientific and personal career

During this talk, we will explore which brainhack principles apply to a cognitive neuroscientist (spoiler: all!), what benefits they bring (countless!), and what obstacles might arise (and how to face them!). Dr. Borghesani will draw from her own experience as an early career researcher who is focusing on study of language and uses both neuropsychological and neuroimaging approaches.
