Welcome back to a fresh new edition of Brainhack Donostia!

Brainhack Donostia is not any ordinary conference but an event focused on cooperation and collaboration in Neuroscience, as well as the promotion of Open Science. Our aim is to explore the multiple applications of neuroimaging tools from a cross-disciplinary perspective. With this goal in mind, we bring together students, researchers, users, and non-academic industry professionals to learn about and develop collaborative projects. Brainhack Donostia is part of a larger initiative that holds simultaneous events all over the world with this same goal (www.brainhack.org). A cornerstone of Brainhack is the promotion of responsible research and innovation in an inclusive, open, and transparent manner. Accordingly, knowledge sharing activities and the use of open-source resources are two of the basic tenets of Brainhack. Through talks, hands-on tutorials, and the development of projects, attendees explore and actively learn how to deal with data acquired using different neuroimaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magneto- and Electroencephalography (M/EEG), or Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).

If you'd like to know more about what the different working groups have prepared for this year's edition, go check out our [schedule](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io/schedule/)!
